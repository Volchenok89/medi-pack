## Description

This web application will allow people to check in online for a doctor’s visit and describe their symptoms. Patients can also go to the pharmacy site and checkout products.
They can navigate trough the site and check the covid-19 page.

Then, if there is a simple treatment, it will avoid a long trip to the doctor’s office in rush hours.

Doctors can simply prescribe medication requests made by users. They can also answer messages from their patients, 
and will be able to change the status of a patient's visit.
